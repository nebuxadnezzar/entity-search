{"title":"Gordon Ramsey","article":"It seems like there's no shortage of celebrities these days who get all shy when the time comes to pay their taxes, and Gordon Ramsay is no different. In 2009, Ramsay appeared in London's High Court, having failed to pay taxes on a restaurant he owned at Heathrow Airport. In the end, he was forced to pay up \u00a37.2 million (or over $9 million) in unpaid taxes. Then, in 2010, the New York Post reported that Ramsay owed some $2 million in taxes off his New York-based restaurant, Gordon Ramsay at The London, which he had sold at the end of 2009. At the time, a spokesman for Ramsay told the News of the World: Conversations are in hand with US authorities to settle outstanding corporate liabilities. In 2013, things became even more serious when documents surfaced written by Ramsay's ex-finance director Trevor James, revealing that the chef's business had misled HMRC in order to reduce its tax bill. Faced with accusations of fraud and a huge, seven-figure unpaid tax bill, a spokesperson for Ramsay insisted that the chef himself had triggered the investigation when he became aware of misconduct by his business' employees when it had been run under previous management. Deloitte, Ramsay's law firm, declined to comment on reports that five of its senior partners have been trawling through 30,000 emails in an attempt to clear the chef's name."}
{"title":"Disney Controvercy","article":"Disney has a history of firing or parting ways with stars over their cultural or political views.From Gina Carano, who was fired from The Mandalorian, to Chris Harrison, who left The Bachelor, Disney seems to be swayed by public opinion when it comes to making decisions about who is associated with the company. Here are stars who were axed by the company over their cultural or political views. Gina Carano was fired by Disney and LucasFilms from The Mandalorian after she received backlash online over controversial tweets. The final straw occurred when Carano compared the current divide in American politics to Nazi Germany. However, the actress didn't apologize for her tweets. Instead, Carano claimed during an interview with Ben Shapiro she was let go because she wasn't going along with the narrative. Chris Harrison was removed from his hosting duties of The Bachelor franchise after he received backlash over comments he made defending a contestant. Harrison was accused of defending contestant Rachael Kirkconnell's past racially insensitive behavior during an interview with Rachel Lindsay, the franchise's first Black Bachelorette. Kirkconnell was Matt James' pick. I actually got to celebrate my birthday thanks to this beautiful woman [his girlfriend Lauren Zima]. James Gunn, writer and director of Guardians of the Galaxy, was fired by Disney in 2018 after tweets he wrote between 2008 and 2012 resurfaced. The director had written jokes about sensitive topics, including rape, pedophilia, 9/11 and child abuse."}
